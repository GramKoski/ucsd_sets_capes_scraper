UC San Diego course evaluation website scraper. Gets course evaluation data from SETS and CAPES for every couse since Summer 2007

The external files that are queried from and written to such as any html, json, or list of professors
is sensitive information and thus will not be added to the github. In general you must need valid UC San Diego authentication
information to use this project. You must set up and save the necessary files manually beforehand to get started scraping. If you have any 
questions please contact me.
